There are many ways to ensure that your code, program, or software is functional and secure. What I have learned from this course is that constant and consistent testing is the easiest way. I have noticed myself testing my code after every code block I write and fixing any issues that may have arrived. When it comes to user needs, first off the program has to functional to its intended purposes. The way I can tell it is functioning properly is looking at the requirements for the project. Now to find the requirements, I have to ask the right questions from the beginning and throughout the development process to know exactly what this program needs to do and exactly how it is going to be used. From there I can add quality of life updates to the code to make the end product better than what was originally intended. When it comes to designing software there are many different ways to approach it. However, designing software is such a vast term the you truly need to know exactly what it is you are designing first. from there you will need to find the requirements, create a plan or map the project out, develop the project while testing the entire way through to completion. If I am working in a team I would need to work very closely with the testing team or development team depending on which one I find myself.
